原文中英对照
Hello and welcome back to English with Lucy. 
I’ve got a new microphone,very exciting. 
A lot of you have been commenting on my radio quality, 
so I’m going to try and improve it with this. 
I’ve also ordered another one for voiceovers, 
so hopefully my audio quality from now on will be wonderful.
For one thing I am having trouble with at the moment is my focus, 
so please bear with me with this with this lesson, 
because I know that my focus isn’t great, it’s something I’m working on.
so today’s lesson is going to be a pronunciation lesson.
你们好，欢迎回到“和Lucy学英语”。我有了一个新的麦克风，很兴奋。因为很多观众一直在评论我的收音质量，所以我准备试着用这个（麦克风）来改善它。我也给旁白播音员买了一个，希望从现在开始我的声音质量会非常棒。一方面现在我的专注力还有一点点问题，所以请大家这节课稍微容忍我一下，因为我知道我的专注力不适非常好，这是我一直在努力改善的。
今天的课是发音课。

Oxford did a study of over 1 billion words 
and they chose the 100 most used words in the English language, 
so I’ve taken those 100 words and I’m going to pronounce them for you. 
Now in my opinion, the absolute best way to sound more like a native speaker is to imitate other native speakers, 
so I want you to imitate or to copy me, 
so I’ll say the word and then you repeat, 
I’ll say it again and then you repeat and then we move on to the next one. 
牛津大学对10亿多单词进行了一项研究，他们从英语中选择出了100个最常用的单词，我已经拿到了这100个单词，接下来我将读给你们听。我认为听起来更像母语者的最佳的方法就是去模仿其他母语者们。所以我希望你们来模仿或者效仿我，我将说一个单词，然后你来重复，我将再说一遍，你再重复，然后我们再进行下一个单词。

Now remember that I am speaking British English, 
so my pronunciation will be different to an American speakers’ pronunciation. 
American English can be quite different, 
but just as beautiful. Now these words might seem quite easy to you, 
because they’re words that we use all the time, 
but really concentrate on the vowel sounds, 
because in many languages like Spanish you have 5 vowel sounds and in British English we have 12 vowel sounds as well as diphthongs. 
Now I do have the list the complete list of the words in the description box, 
so if you are looking for the pronunciation of a specific word, 
then you can check that and click on the right timing. 
Okay let’s begin:
记住，我是说英式英语的，所以我的发音与美式英语的发音不同。美式英语很不同，但是同样好听。这些单词看起来对你来说可能很简单，因为这是我们总在用的单词，但是要密切注意元音声，因为在很多语言中，例如西班牙语有5个元音声，英语有12个元音声，还有双元音。现在描述框里面有这些单词的完整列表，如果你想查找具体某个单词的发音，你可以去里面查看然后点击右边的timing。好，那我们现在开始吧：
