A Frequency Dictionary of  
Contemporary American English
A Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary American English is an invaluable tool for all 
learners of American English, providing a list of the 5,000 most frequently used words  
in the language.
The dictionary is based on data from a 385-million-word corpus—evenly balanced 
between spoken English (unscripted conversation from radio and TV shows), fiction  
(books, short stories, movie scripts), more than 100 popular magazines, ten newspapers, 
and 100 academic journals—for a total of nearly 150,000 texts.
All entries in the rank frequency list feature the top 20–30 collocates (nearby words)  
for that word, which provide valuable insight into the meaning and usage. Alphabetical  
and part of speech indexes are provided for ease of use. The dictionary also contains  
31 thematically organized and frequency-ranked lists of words on a variety of topics, such 
as family, sports, and food. New words in the language, differences between American and 
British English, and grammar topics such as the most frequent phrasal verbs are also 
covered.
A Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary American English is an engaging and efficient 
resource enabling students of all levels to get the most out of their study of vocabulary.

Series preface
Frequency information has a central role to play in learning a language. Nation (1990) 
showed that the 4,000–5,000 most frequent words account for up to 95 percent of a 
written text and the 1,000 most frequent words account for 85 percent of speech. 
Although Nation’s results were only for English, they do provide clear evidence that, when 
employing frequency as a general guide for vocabulary learning, it is possible to acquire a 
lexicon which will serve a learner well most of the time. There are two caveats to bear in 
mind here. First, counting words is not as straightforward as it might seem. Gardner (2007) 
highlights the problems that multiple word meanings, the presence of multiword items, 
and grouping words into families or lemmas, have on counting and analysing words. 
Second, frequency data contained in frequency dictionaries should never act as the only 
information source to guide a learner. Frequency information is nonetheless a very good 
starting point, and one which may produce rapid benefits. It therefore seems rational to 
prioritize learning the words that you are likely to hear and read most often. That is the 
philosophy behind this series of dictionaries.
Lists of words and their frequencies have long been available for teachers and learners 
of language. For example, Thorndike (1921, 1932) and Thorndike and Lorge (1944) 
produced word frequency books with counts of word occurrences in texts used in the 
education of American children. Michael West’s General Service List of English Words (1953) 
was primarily aimed at foreign learners of English. More recently, with the aid of efficient 
computer software and very large bodies of language data (called corpora), researchers have 
been able to provide more sophisticated frequency counts from both written text and 
transcribed speech. One important feature of the resulting frequencies presented in this 
series is that they are derived from recently collected language data. The earlier lists for 
English included samples from, for example, Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and Defoe’s 
Robinson Crusoe, thus they could no longer represent present-day language in any sense.
Frequency data derived from a large representative corpus of a language brings students 
closer to language as it is used in real life as opposed to textbook language (which often 
distorts the frequencies of features in a language, see Ljung, 1990). The information in 
these dictionaries is presented in a number of formats to allow users to access the data in 
different ways. So, for example, if you would prefer not to simply drill down through the 
word frequency list, but would rather focus on verbs for example, the part of speech index 
will allow you to focus on just the most frequent verbs. Given that verbs typically account 
for 20 percent of all words in a language, this may be a good strategy. Also, a focus on 
function words may be equally rewarding—60 percent of speech in English is composed  
of a mere 50 function words. The series also provides information of use to the language 
teacher. The idea that frequency information may have a role to play in syllabus design is 
not new (see, for example, Sinclair and Renouf, 1988). However, to date it has been difficult 
for those teaching languages other than English to use frequency information in syllabus 
design because of a lack of data.

Frequency information should not be studied to the exclusion of other contextual  
and situational knowledge about language use and we may even doubt the validity of 
frequency information derived from large corpora. It is interesting to note that Alderson 
(2007) found that corpus frequencies may not match a native speaker’s intuition about 
estimates of word frequency and that a set of estimates of word frequencies collected from 
language experts varied widely. Thus corpus-derived frequencies are still the best current 
estimate of a word’s importance that a learner will come across. Around the time of the 
construction of the first machine-readable corpora, Halliday (1971: 344) stated that “a 
rough indication of frequencies is often just what is needed.” Our aim in this series is to 
provide as accurate as possible estimates of word frequencies.

Introduction
The	value	of	this	frequency	dictionary	of	
English
“I don’t know that word.” “What does that word 
mean?” “How is that word used?” These are some  
of the most common pleas for help by language 
learners—and justifiably so.
Not knowing enough words, or the right words,  
is often the root cause of miscommunication, the 
inability to read and write well, and a host of related 
problems. This fundamental need is compounded  
by the fact that there are simply so many words to 
know in any language, but especially in English, 
which may contain well over two million distinct 
words (Crystal, 1995)—and growing fast. Thirty years 
ago, who would have thought that we would be 
“surfing” in our own homes, or that “chips” would 
be good things to have inside our equipment, or 
that we would be excited “to google this” and  
“to google that.”
Without belaboring the obvious, it is little 
wonder that learners, teachers, researchers, materials 
developers, and many others are interested in 
establishing some sense of priority and direction  
to what could easily become vocabulary chaos.  
Our frequency dictionary is designed for this very 
purpose. We wanted to know which of the vast 
number of English words to start with, and we  
also wanted to know which other words these  
words “hang out with”—their neighbors (or 
collocates)—which provides crucial information 
about the meaning and use of these words. Perhaps 
even more importantly, we wanted to know this for 
our current day, not for some English of the past, 
when punch cards were used to program computers, 
and when surfing was only done at the beach.  
In short, we offer A Frequency Dictionary of 
Contemporary American English with the hope that 
it will benefit those who are trying to learn our 
current mother tongue, as well as for those who 
desire to assist them.
As a final introductory note, we might mention 
that if you find this dictionary valuable and would 
like a similar electronic version (fewer collocates,  
but more of other features), feel free to visit  
http://www.americancorpus.org/dictionary.
What	is	in	this	dictionary?
This frequency dictionary is designed to meet the 
needs of a wide range of language students and 
teachers, as well as those who are interested in  
the computational processing of English. The main 
index contains the 5,000 most common words in 
American English, starting with such basic words as 
the and of, and quickly progressing through to more 
intermediate and advanced words. Because the 
dictionary is based on the actual frequency of words 
in a large 400-million-word corpus (collection of 
texts) of many different types of English texts 
(spoken, fiction, magazines, newspaper, and 
academic), the user can feel comfortable that these 
words are very likely to be encounter in the “real 
world.”
In addition to providing a listing of the most 
frequent 5,000 words, the entries provide other 
information that should be of great use to the 
language learner. Each entry shows the main 
collocates for each word, grouped by part of speech 
and in order of frequency. These collocates provide 
important and useful insight into the meaning and 
usage of the word, following the idea that “you can 
tell a lot about a word by the other words that it 
hangs out with.” The entries also show where each 
of the collocates occur with regards to the head 
word (before, after, or both), which denotes whether 
they are subject, object, and so on. Finally, the 
entries indicate whether the words are more 
common in one genre of English (e.g. spoken or 
academic) than in the others.
Aside from the main frequency listing, there are 
also indexes that sort the entries by alphabetical 
order and part of speech. The alphabetical index can 
be of great value to students who, for example, want 
to look up a word from a short story or newspaper 
article, and see how common the word is in general.

2	 	 Introduction
The part of speech indexes could be of benefit to 
students who want to focus selectively on verbs, 
nouns, or some other part of speech. Finally, there 
are a number of thematically related lists (clothing, 
foods, emotions, etc.) as well as comparisons of 
vocabulary across genres and over time, all of which 
should enhance the learning experience. The 
expectation, then, is that this frequency dictionary 
will significantly maximize the efforts of a wide 
range of students and teachers who are involved in 
the acquisition and teaching of English vocabulary.
Comparison	to	other	frequency	
dictionaries	of	English
Historically, most frequency dictionaries (also referred 
to as word books and word lists) have been created 
to meet educational needs, with many designed 
specifically to meet the needs of foreign- and 
second-language learners of English. Prominent 
among these are: The Teachers Word Book of  
30,000 Words (Thorndike and Lorge, 1944)—based 
on 4.5 million words from general English texts, 
magazines, and juvenile books; The General Service 
List of English Words (West, 1953)—a list of the  
2,000 highest frequency words (with semantic 
distinctions and counts) based on visual inspections 
by semanticists of 5 million words from various 
sources (encyclopedias, magazines, textbooks,  
novels, etc.); the Brown Corpus list (Francis and 
Kugera, 1982)—based on 1 million words of written 
American English; and its British English 
counterpart—the LOB corpus list (Johansson and 
Hofland, 1989).
For many purposes, these latter two replaced the 
older lists of Thorndike and Lorge. Additionally, there 
are several more specialized school lists, such as: the 
American Heritage Word Frequency Book (Carroll, 
Davies, and Richman 1971)—based on 5 million 
running words of written school English (grades  
3 through 9); the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 
2000)—570 academic word families based on  
3.5 million running words of academic texts;  
and the very early A Basic Vocabulary of Elementary 
School Children (Rinsland, 1945)—based on  
6 million running words of actual children’s  
writing samples.
A great debt is owed to the pioneering scholars 
who generated these and other frequency lists to 
facilitate English vocabulary learning, research, and 
description. Building on these earlier efforts,  
A Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary American 
English addresses several vocabulary needs in the 
field of English language education. First, and 
perhaps most obvious, it is based on contemporary 
American English, thus making it more ecologically 
valid in educational and research settings where 
American English is the target, and where many  
are still relying on the nearly 30-year-old Brown 
Corpus (Francis and Kugera, 1982) for frequency 
information about American English vocabulary. 
(Note: the actual texts for the Brown Corpus were 
from 1961.) Second, unlike the Brown Corpus (1 
million words of written English only), the frequency 
counts in this dictionary are based on a very large 
and balanced corpus of both written and spoken 
materials (400 million words from five major genres), 
thus adding confidence that the highest frequency 
words have indeed been determined and properly 
ranked, and that these words have a high degree of 
utility across major genres of importance to English 
language learners (spoken, fiction, newspapers, 
magazines, and academic).
Third, the inclusion of collocates (by part of 
speech) for each of the 5,000 high-frequency node 
words adds a semantic richness to the dictionary 
that is often lacking when only the forms of words 
are tallied without consideration of their potential 
meanings (Gardner, 2007). The tightness of some  
of these node-collocate relationships (big deal, bad 
habit, make sense, trash talk, etc.) also highlights  
the phrasal nature of many English vocabulary  
items (Cowie, 1998). Such collocational knowledge  
is a crucial component of what it means to know  
a word (Nation, 2001) and has also been recognized 
as a characteristic difference between native and 
non-native language abilities (Nesselhauf, 2005). 
Therefore, language learners and their teachers 
should benefit from the rich semantic and pragmatic 
information the collocates provide, thus taking us 
one step closer to Read’s (2000) call for new  
high-frequency word lists that are based on large 
electronic corpora, but which also account for the 
many meanings that language learners need to 
negotiate. Although semantic frequency is not fully 
realized in this dictionary, the collocates do provide 
some support for semantic interpretations, and will 
certainly aid in determining which meanings of a 
word form to teach and learn.

	 Introduction	 	 3	
Finally, the 30 call-out boxes in this dictionary 
are packed with useful vocabulary information for 
language learners and their teachers, including  
words that make up many of the basic semantic  
sets of the language (animals, body, clothing, colors, 
emotions, family, food, etc.), words that characterize  
a specific genre of the language (spoken, fiction, 
academic, etc.), words that are new to American 
English, words that tend to be characteristically 
American or British, productive suffixes and the 
actual content words they are found in (nouns and 
adjectives), and the highest frequency phrasal verbs 
of American English. (Compare with Gardner and 
Davies, 2007, which lists the highest frequency 
phrasal verbs of British English.) These and other 
call-out boxes in the dictionary can be used for  
self-study, teaching, assessment, materials 
development, and research purposes.
To our knowledge, there is only one other 
publicly accessible frequency dictionary of English 
that is based on a large mega-corpus—Word 
Frequencies in Written and Spoken English (Leech, 
Rayson, and Wilson, 2001). However, our dictionary  
is quite different in at least three major respects. 
First, the Longman frequency dictionary represents 
British, not American, English, and it bases its  
word-frequency information on the British National 
Corpus (BNC). Second, most of the texts in the BNC 
are at least 20 years old, while texts in the Corpus of 
Contemporary American English (COCA) are current 
through late 2008. Third, while both corpora are 
balanced for genre (e.g. spoken, fiction, newspaper, 
and academic), COCA (400 million words) is nearly 
four times as large as the BNC (100 million words), 
allowing us to have more confidence in determining 
the words that should “make the list” and in finding 
their meaningful neighbors.
In addition to the differences in focus, age, and 
sampling size between the two dictionaries, there are 
also differences in the presentation formats. The 
Longman dictionary is mainly composed of straight 
frequency lists of words and lemmas, while this 
dictionary is oriented specifically to language 
learners, supplementing the frequency listings with 
the unique features previously mentioned: (a) 
frequency-ranked collocates (co-occurring words) for 
each headword in the frequency dictionary—which 
can help learners and their teachers better 
understand the meanings and uses of the high 
frequency words; and (b) the more than  
30 thematically oriented vocabulary lists (call-out 
boxes) for particular semantic, grammatical, or  
lexical categories that would be helpful for language 
training purposes.
The	corpus
A frequency dictionary is only as good as the corpus 
on which it is based. The Corpus of Contemporary 
American English (COCA) is the largest balanced 
corpus of American English, and the largest balanced 
corpus of any language that is publicly available 
(http://www.americancorpus.org). In addition to being 
very large (400 million words; 20 million words each 
year 1990–2007), the corpus is also balanced evenly 
between spoken (unscripted conversation from 150+ 
radio and TV shows), fiction (e.g. books, short  
stories, movie scripts), 100+ popular magazines, ten 
newspapers, and 100+ academic journals—for a total 
of 150,000+ texts.
The more than 150,000 texts come from a 
variety of sources:
Spoken• : (79 million words) transcripts of 
unscripted conversation from more than 150 
different TV and radio programs (e.g. All Things 
Considered (NPR), Newshour (PBS), Good Morning 
America (ABC), Today Show (NBC), 60 Minutes 
(CBS), Hannity and Colmes (Fox), Jerry Springer, 
etc.). (See notes on the naturalness and 
authenticity of the language from these 
transcripts.)
Fiction• : (76 million words) short stories and plays 
from literary magazines, children’s magazines, 
popular magazines, first chapters of first edition 
books 1990–present, and movie scripts.
Popular magazines• : (81 million words) nearly  
100 different magazines, with a good mix 
(overall, and by year) between specific domains 
(news, health, home and gardening, women, 
financial, religion, sports, etc.). A few examples 
are Time, Men’s Health, Good Housekeeping, 
Cosmopolitan, Fortune, Christian Century, Sports 
Illustrated, etc.
Newspapers• : (76 million words) ten newspapers 
from across the US, including: USA Today, New 
York Times, Atlanta Journal Constitution, San 
Francisco Chronicle, etc. In most cases, there is  
a good mix between different sections of the

newspaper, such as local news, opinion, sports, 
financial, etc.
Academic journals• : (76 million words) nearly  
100 different peer-reviewed journals. These were 
selected to cover the entire range of the Library 
of Congress classification system (e.g. a certain 
percentage from B (philosophy, psychology, 
religion), D (world history), K (education),  
T (technology), etc.), both overall and by  
number of words per year.
In summary, the corpus is very well balanced at both 
the “macro” level (e.g. spoken, fiction, newspapers) 
and the “micro” level (i.e. the types of texts and the 
distribution of the sources) within each of these 
macro genres.
Annotating	and	organizing	the	data	from	
the	corpus
In order to create a frequency dictionary, the words 
in the corpus must be tagged (for part of speech) 
and lemmatized. Tagging means that a part of 
speech is assigned to each word—noun, verb, and so 
on. Lemmatization means that each word form is 
assigned to a particular “head word” or “lemma”, 
such as go, goes, going, went, and gone being marked 
as forms of the lemma go.
The tagging and lemmatization was done with 
the CLAWS tagger (Version 7), which is the same 
tagger that was used for the British National Corpus 
(http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) and for other 
important corpora of English as well. One of the 
most difficult parts of tagging, of course, is to 
correctly assign the part of speech for words that are 
potentially ambiguous. In cases such as computer, 
disturb, lazy, or fitfully, these are unambiguously 
tagged as noun, verb, adjective, and adverb, 
respectively. But in a case such as light, the word can 
be a noun (he turned on the light), verb (should we 
light the fire?), or adjective (there was a light breeze). 
In these circumstances, the tagger looks at the 
context in which the word occurs in each instance 
to determine the correct part of speech. While the 
CLAWS tagger is very good, it does produce errors. 
We have tried to correct for most of these, but there 
are undoubtedly still some that remain.
It of course makes sense to provide separate 
entries in the dictionary for words with different 
parts of speech, such as noun and verb. For example, 
the word beat as a noun has collocates such as hear, 
miss, steady, drum, and rhythm. As a verb, however, 
it takes collocates such as heart, egg, bowl, severely, 
or Yankees. Even in cases where the word appears as 
a noun and an adjective (magic, potential, dark, 
veteran), the collocates for the two parts of speech 
are very different, and it would probably be too 
confusing to conflate them into one entry. Perhaps 
the most problematic are function words such as 
since, which appear up to three times in this 
dictionary. In the case of since, for example, it 
appears as preposition (he’s been here since 1942), 
adverb (several other schools have since been 
constructed), and conjunction (since they won’t be 
here until 5 pm, we’ll just leave for a minute). In 
these cases, we have simply followed the output of 
the tagger. If it says that there are multiple different 
parts of speech, then the word appears under each 
of those parts of speech in the dictionary.
Frequency	and	dispersion
After the tagging and lemmatization of the  
400 million words in the corpus, our final step  
was to determine exactly which of these words 
would be included in the final list of the 5,000  
most frequent words (or lemmas). One approach 
would be to simply use frequency counts. For 
example, all lemmas that occur 5,000 times or more 
in the corpus might be included in the dictionary. 
Imagine, however, a case where a particular scientific 
term was used repeatedly in engineering articles or 
in sports reporting in newspapers, but it did not 
appear in any works of fiction or in any of the 
spoken texts. Alternatively, suppose that a given  
word is spread throughout an entire register (spoken, 
fiction, newspaper, or academic), but that it is still 
limited almost exclusively to that register. Should  
the word still be included in the frequency 
dictionary? The argument could be made that  
we should look at more than just raw frequency 
counts in cases such as this, and that we ought  
to look at “dispersion” as well, or how well the  
word is “spread across” all of the registers in the 
entire corpus.
In our dictionary, we have used Juilland’s  
“d dispersion index”. A score of 1.00 means that the 
word is perfectly spread across the corpus, so that if 
we divided the corpus into one hundred equally 
sized sections (each with 4 million words, in the case 
9780415490641_4_000int.indd   4 10/14/09   4:23:58 PM

	 Introduction	 	 5	
of our 400 million word corpus), the word would 
have exactly the same frequency in each section.  
A dispersion score of .10, on the other hand, would 
mean that it occurs a lot in a handful of sections, 
and perhaps not at all or very little in the other 
sections.
As a clear example of the contrast between 
“frequency” and “dispersion”, consider Table 1. All of 
the words in this table have essentially the same 
frequency—an average of about 3,000 occurrences 
in the corpus. The words to the left, however, have a 
“dispersion” score of at least 0.95, which means that 
the word has roughly the same frequency in all of 
the 100 sections of the corpus that we used for the 
calculation. The words to the right, on the other 
hand, have a much lower dispersion score. Most 
would easily agree that the words shown at the left 
would be more useful in a frequency dictionary, 
because they represent a wide range of texts and 
text types in the corpus. Therefore, as we can see, 
frequency alone is probably not sufficient to determine 
whether a word should be in the dictionary.
The	final	calculation
The calculation to determine which words are 
included in this frequency dictionary was a fairly 
straightforward one. The formula was simply:
score = frequency * dispersion
For example, consider the words near 3210 in  
the frequency dictionary (see Table 2). The word 
furthermore has a higher frequency (9594 tokens) 
than the other two words, but it has lower  
dispersion (.86). Orange, on the other hand,  
has a lower frequency (8881 tokens) but it has  
better dispersion across the corpus. Taxpayer 
(frequency of 9140 and dispersion of .90) is in  
the middle of both of these. But with the formula 
that takes into account both frequency and 
dispersion, these three words end up having  
more or less the same score.

The 5,000 lemmas with the top score (frequency * 
dispersion) are those that appear in this frequency 
dictionary.

6	 	 Introduction
Collocates
A unique feature of this frequency dictionary is the 
listing of the top collocates (nearby words) for each 
of the 5,000 words in the frequency listing. These 
collocates provide important and useful insight into 
the meaning and use of the keyword. To find the 
collocates, we did the following. First, we decided 
which parts of speech to group together in order  
to rank the collocates and show the most frequent 
ones. In the case of verbs, we grouped noun collocates 
(subject: the evidence supports what she said, and 
object: this supports the claim ), and all other 
collocates were grouped as miscellaneous (e.g. with, 
directly, difficult, and prepare for the verb deal ). For 
nouns, we looked for adjectives ( green grass), other 
nouns ( fire station), and verbs (e.g. desire to succeed ). 
For adjectives, we looked for nouns ( fast car ) and all 
other collocates were grouped as miscellaneous 
( completely exhausted, willing to stay, black and 
white ). Finally, for adverbs and other parts of speech, 
we see collocates from all parts of speech listed 
together ( sharply reduce, fewer than, except for ).
To find the collocates for a given word,  
a computer program searched the entire  
400-million-word corpus and looked at each  
context in which that word occurred. In all cases,  
the context (or “span”) of words was four words to 
the left and four words to the right of the “node 
word”. The overall frequency of the collocates in  
each of those contexts was then calculated, and  
the collocates were examined and rated by at least 
four native speakers.
Obviously, common words such as the, of, to, etc. 
were usually the most frequent collocates. To filter 
out these words, we set a Mutual Information (MI) 
threshold of about 2.5. The MI calculation took into 
account the overall frequency of each collocate, so 
that common words were usually eliminated from 
the list.
Using MI is sometimes more an art than a 
science. If the MI is set too low, then high frequency 
“noise words” show up as collocates, whereas if it is 
set too high, then only highly idiomatic collocates 
are found. As an example, the most frequent 
collocates of break as a verb—when the MI score is 
set high at 5.5—are: deadlock, logjam, monotony, 
and stranglehold. These are quite idiomatic and 
don’t really show well the “core meaning” of break. 
On the other hand, the most frequent collocates 
when the MI threshold is set very low at 1.0 are 
down, into, up, and off, which again do not provide  
a good sense of its meaning. Finally, however, when 
we set the MI threshold to 2.5, we find the most 
frequent collocates are: heart, silence, rules, loose, 
leg, and barriers, which (for native speakers, at least), 
probably do relate more to the core meaning and 
usage of break. But getting the MI threshold set just 
right for each of the 5,000 headwords was a bit 
daunting, to say the least. We hope that the data 
found here agree with your intuitions of what these 
words mean and how they are used.
The	main	frequency	index
The main index in this dictionary is a rank-ordered 
listing of the top 5,000 words (lemma) in English, 
starting with the most frequent word (the definite 
article the) and progressing through to warehouse, 
paradise, and nominate, which are the last three 
words in the list. The following information is given 
for each entry:
rank	frequency	(1,	2,	3,	.		.		.		),	lemma,	part of 
speech
collocates,	grouped	by	part	of	speech	and	ordered	
by	frequency
raw	frequency,	dispersion	(0.00–1.00),	(indication	of	
register	variation)
As a concrete example, let us look at the entry for 
the verb break:
494 break v
n •law, heart, news, •rule, silence, story, •ground, 
•barrier, leg, bone, •piece, •neck, arm, •cycle, voice• 
misc •into, •away, •free, •apart, •loose
 up marriage, •fight, boyfriend, meeting•, girlfriend, 
union, band, pass, •demonstration, •monotony  
down •into, •barrier, car•, •cry, •door, •tear, talk•, 
enzyme•, completely, negotiation• out war•, fight•, 
fire•, sweat, fighting•, riot•, violence•, •laugh, •hive  
off piece, talk, •engagement, negotiation, branch, 
abruptly, •relation
72917 | 0.97
This entry shows that word number 494 in our rank 
order list is the verb break. The last line of the entry 
shows the raw frequency for the lemma (72,917 
tokens) and the dispersion (.97 in this case). The 
collocates are given in the intervening lines. As can 
be seen, they are partially grouped by part of speech. 
In the case of verbs, we see the noun collocates and 
then other parts of speech (miscellaneous).

	 Introduction	 	 7	
Note also that for some collocates, there is an 
indication of the placement of the collocate. When 
the [ • ] is before the collocate, this means that the 
node word (headword) is typically found before that 
collocate (break the law, break into pieces ). When 
the [ • ] is after the collocate, this means that the 
node word is typically found after the collocate (her 
voice broke, all hell broke loose). This symbol can 
provide useful information, for example, on whether 
the collocates are subjects or objects of a given verb, 
or whether the node word noun acts as a subject or 
object of the verbal collocate. (Note, however, that 
with passives and relative clauses, the noun that is 
object of a verb will occur before the verb, which 
does confuse things a bit.) In order to display the  
[ • ] symbol, 80 percent or more of the tokens of a 
given collocate had to occur either before or after 
the node word. In the case of ADJ / NOUN and 
NOUN / ADJ, word order is typically so consistent 
(blue house, never *house blue) that the [ • ] is not 
used to show placement.
Finally, as is seen above, in the case of some 
verbs that can act as phrasal verbs (break up, turn 
down, cut off, etc.), these are listed in bold (with 
their own collocates) at the end of the regular 
collocates list for verbs. Phrasal verbs are only listed 
when they have a frequency of at least 1,000 in the 
corpus, and when there are at least three collocates 
with a frequency of at least five occurrences each.
Let us consider one other example:
3396 hypothesis n
j null, following, consistent, alternative, working, general, 
initial, original, theoretical, competing n study, support•, 
result, test, research, testing, evidence, analysis, 
method, set v •predict, suggest, reject, examine, 
confirm, base, develop, formulate, •state, •explain
9282 | 0.82 A
This entry is for hypothesis (word #3396 in our list). 
As before, the collocates are listed in frequency order 
and grouped by part of speech. In this case, however, 
note that there is an [ A ] at the end of the entry. 
This indicates that the lemma hypothesis occurs at 
least twice as frequently in the Academic genre as it 
does overall in the corpus (Spoken, Fiction, 
Magazines, Newspapers).
Thematic	vocabulary	(“call-out	boxes”)
Placed throughout the main frequency-based index 
are 31 “call-out boxes”, which serve to display in one 
list a number of thematically related words. These 
include thematic lists of words related to the body, 
food, family, weather, professions, nationalities, colors, 
emotions, and several other semantic domains. 
There are also lists of words that are much more 
common in each of the five main genres (spoken, 
fiction, popular magazines, newspapers, and 
academic) than overall, as well as comparisons of 
American and British vocabulary, as well as new 
words in the language. Finally, there are lists related 
to word formation issues, such as irregular past 
tense and irregular plurals, and common suffixes to 
create nouns, adjectives, and verbs. In each case, the 
entries are, of course, ordered by frequency.
Alphabetical	and	part	of	speech	indexes
The alphabetical index contains all of the words 
listed in the frequency index. Each entry includes 
the following information: 1) lemma 2) part of 
speech, and 3) rank order frequency. The part of 
speech index contains the 5,000 words from the 
frequency index and the alphabetical index. Within 
each of the categories (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) 
the lemma are listed in order of descending 
frequency. Because each entry is linked to the other 
two indexes via the rank frequency number, each of 
he entries in this index contains only the rank 
frequency and lemma.
Electronic	version
As was noted in the first section, if you find  
this dictionary valuable and would like to have  
a similar electronic version (somewhat fewer 
collocates, but more of other features), feel free to 
visit http://www.americancorpus.org /dictionary.
Delimitations
1 Frequency is form-based (lemma), not semantically 
based (homographs—bank, run; heterophones—
lead “metal” vs. lead “be in front”, contract vs. 
contract, etc.). But our approach is an improvement 
over many similar frequency listings because  
the collocates give some indication of potential 
variant meanings. For example, take a look at  
the entries for lead (n) [entry 1598] and bow (n) 
[entry 4139]. For lead, there are collocates for  
the two meanings “metal” and “in front” and for 
bow there are collocates for bow in the context 
of “ship, arrow, hair, and violin”.

8	 	 Introduction
2 Except in the case of high-frequency phrasal 
verbs, only single-word nodes were included. 
When a lemma occurs almost exclusively in a 
given multi-word expression (as far as, in charge 
of, lots of  ), that multi-word expression is listed as 
part of the entry.
3 All collocates are single-word collocates. In cases 
such as in terms of, by means of, etc., each of the 
collocates are listed separately.
4 The most frequent form of a given collocate 
lemma may be an inflected form, not the head 
word form as listed (e.g. long as a collocate of no 
almost always appears as longer in the corpus).
5 In general, proper nouns were not included in 
the dictionary, either as node words or collocates. 
However, a few highly salient proper noun 
collocates were included for certain node words 
(e.g. Iraq as a collocate of invade; China as a 
collocate of export).

22.	 American	vs.	British	English
The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA: http://www.americancorpus.org ) is the largest 
balanced corpus of American English, and the British National Corpus (BNC; http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ ) 
is the largest, balanced corpus of British English. This list shows the difference in vocabulary in these 
two corpora, and is based on the implementation of the BNC found at http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc.
Some of the differences in vocabulary in the two dialects are related to culture, society, politics, or 
current events (e.g. Am Republican, congressional, baseball, Iraqi; Br Tory, parliamentary, Victorian),  
some are just different words for the “same” concept (e.g. store/shop, attorney/solicitor, apartment/flat, 
mom/mum), and some words in COCA (1990–2008) refer to things that are too new to have made it 
into the pre-1993 BNC (e.g. web, Internet, high-tech, online).
+American (COCA) / -British (BNC)
The following are just a sampling of the words that are much more common in COCA than in the BNC. 
In all cases, the word is at least twice as far down the list in the BNC wordlist as in COCA (e.g. #2000 in 
COCA, #5000 in BNC).
Verb: call, report, focus, guess, sign, step, figure, roll, fire, hire, file, oppose, wrap, interview, accomplish,

Adjective: American, federal, tough, native, Iraqi, crazy, smart, Israeli, Mexican, congressional, elementary, 
online, gifted, athletic, ongoing, African-American, suburban, Hispanic, scary, high-tech, cute, nonprofit,

24.	 Comparing	words
One of the challenges for a language learner is to acquire a sense of the nuances between two related 
words—where one would be used, but not the other. With the Corpus of Contemporary American 
English, this is quite easy. Users simply enter the two words, and then the corpus shows which 
collocates (nearby words) occur with one word but not the other, and vice versa. For example, the 
following table shows just a fragment of the output for small versus little. We will not explain all of the 
numbers here, though that explanation is available online. For our purposes, we see that small occurs 
with business and amount, for example, while little occurs with league and secret.
Word 1 (W1): small (35.5%) Word 2 (W2): little (64.5%)
1 amounts 828 7 0.99 2.80 1 while 2115 10 1.00 1.54
2 fraction 517 5 0.99 2.79 2 bit 15677 94 0.99 1.54
3 percentage 902 10 0.99 2.79 3 league 1045 7 0.99 1.54
4 firms 422 5 0.99 2.79 4 brother 1062 10 0.99 1.54
5 businesses 2199 32 0.99 2.78 5 sister 908 11 0.99 1.53
6 telescopes 119 2 0.98 2.77 6 sympathy 142 2 0.99 1.53
7 fee 175 3 0.98 2.77 7 secret 367 6 0.98 1.52
With the web interface, users can compare any set of words, to see semantic (meaning) differences, as 
well as cultural differences in the use of two related words. The following table gives just a small 
sampling of some of these searches.
[A] [B] Collocate POS Collocates with [A] Collocates with [B]
1 [boy] [girl] [ j*] growing, rude sexy, working

30.	 Phrasal	verbs
Phrasal verbs present a problem for non-native speakers in English because these verbs are often so 
idiomatic. For example, in the following phrases the phrasal verb (bold) does not literally mean out, up, 
or over: the play turned out well, I didn’t make up the answer, they took over the city. The following is a 
list of the 100 most frequent phrasal verbs in the Corpus of Contemporary American English.
Note that the part of speech tagger does not attempt to separate more literal and more figurative 
meanings (he looked up the ladder / he looked up several words; she went on a boat / she went on and 
on), and so the following frequencies include both types of meanings. Note also that these frequencies 
do not include separated phrasal verbs (pick it up, wake the children up). Finally, note that these are 
grouped by lemma, so come back = come / comes / came / coming back, etc.
